Declared USERNAME in .env as my postgres username  variable, but my declaration kept getting overridden.
USERNAME is a key on the process.env object. Changed the variable name from USERNAME => KEY and now the KEY variable can be deconstructed
from the process.env file and I can connect to the pg client.
