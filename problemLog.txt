In order to ensure the modal pops up when the container or the img is clicked on, I placed the event listener on the outputArea container. Then check to see if the element that triggered the event has a custom data attribute set to the pokemons name - event bubbling

The order of middleware matters!

Declared USERNAME in .env as my postgres username  variable, but my declaration kept getting overridden.
    USERNAME is a key on the process.env object. Changed the variable name from USERNAME => KEY and now the KEY variable can be deconstructed
    from the process.env file and I can connect to the pg client.
    
"require" does not exist in browser/client-side JavaScript. So was not able to require api functions
    Create the api functions directly in the script instead of having them in one file..not ideal, but good for now

Was getting a "readable stream" and/or pending promise in the front end. 
    Fetch is asynchronus. Had to 'async' the function, await the fetch and the response.json().

Verify Token function was passing every time. 
    Had to switch the condition from bearerToken == null to bearerToken == 'null'
            not sure why this worked-shouldn't type coersion/conversion work here???
